APECOIN IS FOR THE WEB3 ECONOMY.
Culture has found new expression in web3 through art, gaming, entertainment, and events. The possibilities for blockchain’s impact on culture are so endless that they can’t possibly all be predicted yet. APE is a token made to support what’s next, controlled and built on by the community. It will serve as a decentralized protocol layer for community-led initiatives that drive culture forward into the metaverse.
THE APE FOUNDATION
The APE Foundation is the steward of ApeCoin. It is not an overseer, but the base layer on which ApeCoin holders in the ApeCoin DAO can build.
The Foundation facilitates decentralized and community-led governance and is designed to become more decentralized over time. It is tasked with administering the decisions of the ApeCoin DAO, and is responsible for day-to-day administration, bookkeeping, project management, and other tasks that ensure the DAO community’s ideas have the support they need to become a reality.
The goal of the APE Foundation is to steward the growth and development of the APE ecosystem in a fair and inclusive way. It utilizes the Ecosystem Fund, which is controlled by a multisig wallet, to pay its expenses as directed by the ApeCoin DAO and provides an infrastructure for ApeCoin holders to collaborate through open and permissionless governance processes.
THE DAO
ApeCoin DAO exists because decentralized governance is critical to building and managing a globally dispersed community—and therefore critical to the success of the APE ecosystem.
The APE Improvement Proposal Process (see Governance) will allow ApeCoin DAO members to make decisions regarding Ecosystem Fund allocations, governance rules, projects, partnerships, and beyond. ApeCoin DAO membership is open to all ApeCoin holders.
THE BOARD
A special council on the APE Foundation (the DAO’s “Board”) provides, at the behest of the ApeCoin DAO members, oversight of the Foundation administrators. The purpose of the Board is to administer DAO proposals and serve the vision of the community. It meets on proposals requiring administrative review under ApeCoin DAO rules. The initial Board serves a term of six months, after which DAO members will vote annually on Board members.
The first five Special council members were Alexis onchain, Bored ape G, Gerry, Vera and Yat siu.
Since then Alexis and Yat’s term has ended and they have been replaced by Wabaam and Captain Trippy who’ll start their one year term from July 2023.
APECOIN PROTOCOL
ApeCoin is an ERC-20 governance and utility token used within the APE ecosystem to empower a decentralized community building at the forefront of web3.
As the open-source protocol layer of the ecosystem, ApeCoin serves several purposes:Governance : ApeCoin is the ecosystem’s governance token, allowing ApeCoin holders to participate in ApeCoin DAO.
Unification of Spend : ApeCoin is the ecosystem’s utility token, giving all its participants a shared and open currency that can be used without centralized intermediaries.
Access : ApeCoin provides access to certain parts of the ecosystem that are otherwise unavailable, such as exclusive games, merch, events, and services.
Incentivization : ApeCoin is a tool for third-party developers to participate in the ecosystem by incorporating APE into services, games, and other projects.
APECOIN ALLOCATION
The total supply of ApeCoin is permanently fixed at 1 billion tokens. No minting capability is exposed through the contract interface, thus the total supply will never increase. Similarly, the contract interface does not expose any token burning capability, so the total supply will never decrease.
In line with the standard practice, a portion of the tokens for contributors to the project will be initially locked. Locked tokens will be unlocked over a period of 48 months, in accordance with the predetermined unlock schedule in the chart below, starting on launch day, March 17, 2022.
ApeCoin will be distributed among four main groups, as detailed in the chart below. Wallets holding tokens alloted to the DAO treasury and resources can be viewed here.

APECOIN CLAIMING FOR BAYC AND MAYC HOLDERS
Tokens will be allocated to BAYC/MAYC members via the claim page starting on March 17, 2022 at 8:30AM ET.
To ensure a fair launch of ApeCoin to BAYC and MAYC NFT holders, the allocation is informed by the difference in floor price between each collection of NFTs, roughly the month prior to the token claim launch (02/07/22 to 03/08/22). Each Bored Ape or Mutant Ape NFT that has a companion Bored Ape Kennel Club NFT will be able to claim the amount of ApeCoin specified below.
Bored Ape + Kennel Club  : 10,950 tokens
Mutant Ape + Kennel Club : 2,898 tokens 
Bored Ape only : 10,094 tokens
Mutant Ape only : 2,042 tokens
(token IDs do not need to match)


There is no distinction between Mutant Ape types for the claim.
Ape + Kennel token IDs do not need to match to claim, nor does having the original pairing entitle any extra tokens.
This is a one-time claim that will identify all eligible NFTs in your wallet, in the order that they appear. There will not be an option to deselect an eligible NFT if it is present in your wallet. If you wish to claim for one of your NFTs but not another, you will need to move them to separate wallets.
A Bored Ape or Mutant Ape that has claimed its tokens cannot be used later to claim tokens for an accompanying Kennel Club. All paired NFTs must be claimed together at the same time.
Unused Bored Ape Chemistry Club serums do not qualify for token claim.
The airdrop claim tokens associated with any NFT can only be claimed once. In order to check whether a certain BAYC, MAYC (or companion BAKC) has claimed its tokens, use the below checker.
There will be Ethereum network gas fees incurred to claim ApeCoin.
HOW IT WORKS
15% of the total ApeCoin token supply allocated to BAYC/MAYC holders for claim will be transferred to a smart contract. Ownership of the contract will be transferred to a multisig wallet, which will be responsible for:
* initiating the BAYC/MAYC/BAKC claim period
* ending the claim period 90 days after launch
* taking ownership of all unclaimed APE tokens at the end of the claim period
* transferring these unclaimed tokens to the Coinbase Custody wallets that constitute the Ecosystem Fund
The airdrop claim tokens associated with any NFT can only be claimed once. In order to check whether a certain BAYC, MAYC (or BAYC or MAYC with a companion BAKC) has claimed its tokens, use the NFT checker:
APE FOUNDATION IP
The APE Foundation was gifted a 1 of 1 NFT by Yuga Labs, the creators of Bored Ape Yacht Club. Yuga Labs has conveyed all rights and privileges to this NFT and its underlying artwork to the APE Foundation. The ApeCoin DAO can decide how this intellectual property is used.
FAQ
WHO/WHAT ARE THE DIFFERENT ENTITIES AND NAMES, AND HOW DO THEY RELATE TO EACH OTHER?
* Yuga Labs - Yuga Labs is a web3 company best known for the creation of the Bored Ape Yacht Club. It will be a community member in the ApeCoin DAO and will adopt APE as the primary token across new projects.
* BAYC - The Bored Ape Yacht Club is a collection of digital art crafted into NFTs where the token itself doubles as a membership to a swamp club for apes.
* APE Foundation - The APE Foundation is the steward of ApeCoin, a legal entity that exists to administer the decisions of the ApeCoin DAO.
* ApeCoin DAO - A decentralized governance organization that will make decisions regarding Ecosystem Fund allocations, governance rules, projects, partnerships, and more. ApeCoin DAO membership is open to all ApeCoin holders.
* APE - The symbol for ApeCoin token.
DOES THE FOUNDATION CONTROL APECOIN AND/OR THE APECOIN DAO? IF NOT, WHAT ROLE DO THEY PLAY?
The Foundation does not control ApeCoin or the ApeCoin DAO. The Foundation consists of an administrative Board, which exists solely to oversee the decisions of the ApeCoin DAO, as well as a third party project management team in charge of ensuring ApeCoin DAO decisions are implemented.
A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is the best way to give every member of the community a vote on important decisions whether it's a technical upgrade or a decision to fund a new idea. However, the reality is that today a DAO cannot sign a lease or hire people or make merch or whatever the community decides to do on its own. The Foundation is responsible for the day-to-day administration, bookkeeping, project management, and other tasks that ensure the ApeCoin DAO community’s ideas have the support they need to become a reality.
HOW WAS THE FOUNDATION BOARD SELECTED?
Certain members of the community that have strong operational experience were consulted on how to best structure the ApeCoin DAO. Several of these members voiced their willingness to join the Board to oversee the decisions of the community and are committed to upholding and furthering the decentralization of the ApeCoin DAO. The initial Board will serve 6 months.
WILL THERE BE A CHANCE FOR OTHER INDIVIDUALS TO JOIN THE BOARD?
Yes. After the initial 6-month term, DAO members will vote annually to keep existing or appoint new Board members. ApeCoin token holders (the DAO members) can also remove or replace a Board member at any time with a majority “In favor” vote.
WHAT ROLE DOES YUGA LABS PLAY IN ALL OF THIS?
Yuga Labs is a contributor to the APE Ecosystem and will assist in the creation of products and experiences for the ecosystem as a whole.
WHAT WILL THE CHARITABLE DONATION TO THE JANE GOODALL LEGACY FOUNDATION BE USED FOR?
The donation will help secure an invested endowment for the JGLF, helping to fund projects including:
* Long-term research at the Gombe Stream Research Center in Western Tanzania (which been conducted continuously for more than six decades)
* Lake Tanganyika Catchment Reforestation and Education (TACARE), community-centered conservation that preserves chimp habitats in six African countries
* Conservation science that explores, innovates, and discovers new solutions, technologies and tools to protect the environment and wildlife
* Roots & Shoots, a program active in 60+ countries that empowers young people (kindergarten through university) to become involved in hands-on projects for people, animals, and the environment
HOW WERE THE TOKEN ALLOTMENTS FOR BAYC, MAYC, AND BAKC NFT HOLDERS CALCULATED?
The allotment of ApeCoin to NFT holders was a ratio based on the average floor price of BAYC and MAYC from roughly the month prior to launch (02/07/22 to 03/08/22).
WHY DON’T THOSE WITH ONLY BAKC NFTS GET A TOKEN ALLOTMENT?
BAKC NFTs are companion NFTs to BAYC and MAYC, meaning they don’t have utility on their own, only when paired with a BAYC or MAYC


APECOIN DAO GOVERNANCE
The ApeCoin community governs itself via the ApeCoin DAO, the decentralized governance framework that supports the Ecosystem Fund. The DAO follows a proposal process to vote on how the Ecosystem Fund will be distributed by the APE Foundation to promote a diverse and self-sustaining ecosystem.
This governance guide is an overview of the proposal process. It’s a living document that will evolve and improve with the DAO community’s input.
MEMBERSHIP
Participating in idea submission, commentary, proposal submission, and voting is restricted to ApeCoin DAO members. Holding ApeCoin is the only requirement for membership in the DAO.
GUIDING VALUES
* Boldness: We don’t shy away from the weird, the hard, or the new.
* Equality: One APE equals one APE.
* Transparency: Processes and decisions are shared openly with the community.
* Collective Responsibility: We leave everything better than we found it.
* Persistence: Success is an ouroboros, not a straight line.
COMMUNICATION CHANNELS
The APE Foundation website is the DAO hub, providing an interface to educate DAO members on the governance process and provide easy access to the channels below in order to streamline the DAO’s operation and enhance its utility.
Discourse is the first stop for all proposals. An AIP (Ape Improvement Proposal) Idea is submitted as a post in Discourse and must receive confirmation from a moderator that it complies with DAO-approved guidelines before it appears to the community. ApeCoin holders must go through a wallet authentication process to post ideas or give feedback to ideas via comments.
Snapshot is used for voting. Proposal drafts that have passed their respective approval processes become available for voting on Snapshot. ApeCoin holders must go through a wallet authentication process to vote.
PROPOSAL PROCESS
ApeCoin DAO is launching its community-led governance via a formal proposal process based on the one implemented and proven out over time by Ethereum’s EIP system.
PROPOSAL CATEGORIES
There are three main categories an AIP (Ape Improvement Proposal) can fall under: Core, Process, or Informational. Core proposals have two subcategories, Brand Decision and Ecosystem Fund Allocation. Proposals that are being resubmitted must be classified as such.
CORE: ECOSYSTEM FUND ALLOCATION
Proposals for how DAO funds should be utilized.
CORE: ECOSYSTEM FUND ALLOCATION (RESUBMISSION)
Resubmitted proposals for how DAO funds should be utilized.
CORE: BRAND DECISION
Proposals for anything the DAO attaches its name to, including projects and collaborations.
CORE: BRAND DECISION (RESUBMISSION)
Resubmitted proposals for anything the DAO attaches its name to, including projects and collaborations.
PROCESS
Proposals for making a change to a process or implementation. Examples include procedures, guidelines, changes to the decision-making process, and changes to the tools or environment of the DAO or Foundation.
PROCESS (RESUBMISSION)
Resubmitted proposals for making a change to a process or implementation. Examples include procedures, guidelines, changes to the decision-making process, and changes to the tools or environment of the DAO or Foundation.
INFORMATIONAL
Proposals for general guidelines or information for the community.
INFORMATIONAL (RESUBMISSION)
Resubmitted proposals for general guidelines or information for the community.
PROPOSAL TEMPLATE
A proposal typically includes:
* Abstract - Two or three sentences that summarize the proposal.
* Motivation - A statement on why the APE Community should implement the proposal.
* Rationale - An explanation of how the proposal aligns with the APE Community’s mission and guiding values.
* Key Terms (optional) - Definitions of any terms within the proposal that are unique to the proposal, new to the APE Community, and/or industry-specific.
* Specifications - A detailed breakdown of the platforms and technologies that will be used.
* Steps to Implement - The steps to implement the proposal, including associated costs, manpower, and other resources for each step where applicable.
* Timeline - Relevant timing details, including but not limited to start date, milestones, and completion dates.
* Overall Cost - The total cost to implement the proposal.
The author can add additional fields to any template if necessary to fully communicate the intentions, specifics, and implications of the AIP Draft.
Proposals that did not make it through the respective approval process and are being resubmitted should also include:
* Link to original proposal
* Reason it was not approved
* Changes that have been made and why it should now be approved
The author can add additional fields to any template if necessary to fully communicate the changes made and the intentions, specifics, and implications of the resubmitted AIP Draft.
PROPOSAL PHASES
PHASE 1: AIP IDEA
An AIP Idea is submitted as a post in Discourse and must receive moderator confirmation that it complies with DAO-approved guidelines before it appears to the community. The person or people submitting the AIP Idea will be referred to as the author or authors (please note that multiple members can work together on an AIP idea, but it should be submitted only once). The AIP idea informally gathers comments via Discourse for seven days. The author cannot edit the original post — if the author wants to propose changes to the original idea, they must do this via the comments.
PHASE 2: AIP DRAFT
Once the seven-day feedback window has passed and a moderator closes the Discourse topic, a moderator will send the author the proposal template and next steps for submission and voting. They may also suggest a proposal category, if not already specified in Discourse.
The author will fill out the template, incorporating any Discourse feedback that helps the idea better serve the DAO. The author can add additional fields to the template if necessary to fully communicate the intentions, specifics, and implications of the AIP Draft. The moderator may also inform the author of incorrect or missing information that needs to be changed or clarifications that need to be made. If the author does not respond to those moderator requests within 30 days, the AIP Draft will be automatically rejected.
When the moderator confirms an AIP Draft complies with DAO-approved guidelines, they assign a number to the AIP for identification purposes throughout the rest of the process. From this point on, the AIP is referred to as “AIP-#: (Name) - (Category)”. For example the first AIP is “AIP-1: Proposing the DAO - Process”.
PHASE 3: AIP ANALYSIS REPORT
The AIP Draft is reviewed by a project management team engaged by APE Foundation who will provide an AIP Analysis Report to ensure costs, steps to implement, legal considerations, third-party review requirements, potential conflicts of interests, and any further implications have been identified. Given that AIP authors may be submitting drafts with little to no resources, this service for the DAO community ensures that DAO members have enough information about proposals to make informed decisions when voting.
PHASE 4: AIP MODERATION
The AIP Draft + Analysis Report (DAR) Package is reviewed by a team of moderators and either approved or not approved based on whether it adheres to the DAO-approved guidelines. If approved, it becomes a Pending AIP and moves to Phase 5. If not approved, it is eligible for resubmission, except in cases of violation of the law or reasonable suspicion of fraud or other misleading information.
PHASE 5: POST-MODERATION TAGGING
Pending AIPs that have passed AIP Moderation are tagged as “Straight to Vote” or “Needs Administrative Review.”
The “Straight to Vote” tag is given to a pending AIP whose costs, content, and implications are considered straightforward and of no risk to the well-being of the DAO. Any Pending AIP that is tagged as “Straight to Vote” will skip to Phase 7.
The “Needs Administrative Review” tag is given to a pending AIP whose costs, content, or implications are considered complicated or a potential risk to the well-being of the DAO. Any Pending AIP that is tagged as “Needs Administrative Review” must go through Phase 6.
PHASE 6: ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW
For Pending AIPs that have been tagged with “Needs Administrative Review,” the Board, serving in an administrative capacity, will determine whether clarification or action is required before moving a Pending AIP to Phase 7. If clarification or action is not needed, the Pending AIP is tagged as “Approved for Voting” and proceeds to Phase 7. If the Board decides to return a Pending AIP for further clarification or action, they must provide a clear explanation of why and tag it as either “Return for Clarification” or “Return for Reconstruction.”
Reasons to tag as “Return for Clarification” may include but are not limited to:
* Cost to implement unclear/not able to be calculated
* Would use more than 5% of the DAO treasury
* Conflicts with another proposal
Reasons to tag as “Return for Reconstruction” may include but are not limited to:
* Proposal is at odds with the mission/values of the DAO
* Proposal is at odds with the well-being of the DAO
* Violations of law, or against advice of counsel for APE Foundation
* Reasonable suspicion of fraud or other misleading information
PHASE 7: LIVE AIP
Drafts that have passed their respective approval processes will become Live AIPs on Snapshot during the next Weekly AIP Release, which is when new AIPs are released in batches Thursdays at 9PM ET. Once live on Snapshot, Live AIPs are open to voting until Weekly Voting Close, which is at 9PM ET on the Wednesday following their release. Moderators are the only ones that can post AIPs to Snapshot because they must confirm that each one has gone through the correct approvals process.
PHASE 8: FINAL AIP
If a Live AIP has not gotten any votes or is tied by the Vote Close Time, it will be tagged as “Stalled” and be eligible for Resubmission. In all other cases, Live AIPs are moved to one of two Final AIP categories. Rejected Final AIPs can be resubmitted via the appropriate Resubmission Template if the author contacts a moderator. Accepted Final AIPs move into Implementation.
PHASE 9: IMPLEMENTATION
For Accepted Final AIPs, implementation will begin based on the steps outlined in the AIP template. The project management team engaged by the APE Foundation is responsible for making sure this happens, but is not responsible for doing it themselves.
PROPOSAL CONFLICTS
If a suggested proposal directly conflicts with a proposal that is currently up for vote, the second proposal should not go for a vote until a decision is made on the first proposal to avoid approval of opposing requirements.
A suggested proposal that directly conflicts with another approved proposal cannot go to vote for three months after the original proposal has been implemented to avoid wasting community assets.
VOTING
ApeCoin DAO’s consensus mechanism aims to make placing votes fair, transparent, and low-cost, so that ApeCoin holders can participate in the decision-making of the DAO.
VOTING MECHANISM
Snapshot was chosen as a voting tool that:
* doesn’t require gas payment
* ensures transparency
* expands governance participation to all holders of ApeCoin
VOTING PROCESS
1. Moderators post AIPs to Snapshot after ensuring that each one has gone through the correct approvals process. New AIPs are posted every week on Thursday at 9PM ET. This is when the six-day voting window opens as well.
2. DAO members vote on Snapshot. One ApeCoin is equal to one vote. As votes cannot be divided into fractions and the total number of votes shouldn’t ever exceed the number of tokens minted, the number of votes will be rounded down if a fractional number of tokens is owned by the voter (i.e., 100.1 tokens will result in 100 votes, and so will 100.9 tokens). The voting options for a Live AIP are “In favor” and “Against.” Voting “In favor” means the voter is in favor of implementing the AIP exactly as-is. Voting “Against” means the vote is against implementing the AIP exactly as-is — you may vote “Against” to encourage the author to resubmit the AIP after making changes.
3. The voting for each proposal in each weekly batch will be open for voting for six days, closing at 9PM ET on the following Wednesday.
4. Proposals that receive a majority “In favor” vote are moved into implementation. Proposals that are rejected will have the chance to be resubmitted via the appropriate Resubmission Template if the author contacts a moderator to initiate this process. If by the Vote Close Time the Live AIP has not gotten any votes or is tied, it will be tagged as “Stalled” and be eligible for Resubmission.
VOTING DELEGATION
DAO members have the ability to delegate their vote.
* DAO members can delegate their vote to another DAO member that they consider to be a trusted subject matter expert.
* Voting delegation is the mechanism by which DAO members with tokens under initial lock-up will be able to vote.
THE FUTURE OF APECOIN DAO
Over time, ApeCoin DAO will transition the proposal and voting mechanisms into a full, on-chain platform in a form determined by the community. The DAO can do this by:
* Hiring DAO members to take care of administrative, project management, and moderation tasks to replace the company appointed
* Creating a community-steering committee
* Implementing on-chain voting
* Voting annually to elect members for the DAO’s Board (the initial Board is in place for a shorter term of six months)
REFERENCE
APECOIN DAO TERMINOLOGY
* AIP (APE Improvement Proposal) - a document proposing a new feature, project, activity, goal, piece of information, or change to any proposal that has already been implemented.
* AIP Idea - the first step in the process of creating an official AIP, which will be presented to the community for gathering informal feedback for a period of seven days.
* AIP Draft - the second step in the process of creating an official AIP, which can only be submitted after the original AIP idea has gathered feedback from the community for seven days in the proper channel. An AIP draft must be submitted directly to a moderator via predetermined AIP templates.
* AIP Template - the preset format for an AIP draft, which will vary slightly depending on the nature of the intended AIP.
* AIP Author - the DAO member responsible for beginning the APE Improvement Process, starting with presenting the idea to the community via the proper AIP idea process. The AIP author is responsible for incorporating relevant feedback, submitting the subsequent AIP draft via the proper AIP template to the moderator, and responding to questions or requests for clarifications from DAO members and moderators. Any ApeCoin holder can be an AIP author.
* AIP Categories - the predetermined classification system for organizing AIPs by their nature or intent. They are: Core Proposal, Ecosystem Fund Allocation Proposal (a subcategory of Core Proposal), Brand Decision Proposal (a subcategory of Core Proposal), Process Proposal, and Informational Proposal.
* Core Proposal - a proposal that would be considered the main activities of the DAO, with subcategories that can be expanded on over time via proposal submission.
* Ecosystem Fund Allocation Proposal - a proposal about how the Ecosystem Fund should be spent. A subcategory of Core Proposals.
* Brand Decision Proposal - a proposal about to whom the community wants to attach its name. This is different from an Ecosystem Fund Allocation Proposal in that it can have associated costs to implement but is not at its core a proposal about Ecosystem Fund Allocation. A subcategory of Core Proposals.
* Process Proposal - a proposal about making a change to a process or proposing an implementation. Examples include procedures, guidelines, changes to the decision-making process, and changes to the tools or environment of the DAO or Foundation.
* Informational Proposal - a proposal that provides general guidelines or information to the community but does not propose a new feature.
* Resubmission Proposal - a proposal that was previously submitted but did not pass either due to initial rejection by moderators or the Board, or by not passing a vote. All proposal categories have a special template for resubmission that the author must link to the original proposal, clearly state why it did not pass, and clearly explain how the resubmission is different.
* AIP Analysis Report - a report conducted by a project management team engaged by the APE Foundation to ensure that all costs, steps to implement, legal considerations, third-party review requirements, potential conflicts of interests, and any further implications have been properly considered and identified. This is considered to be a service for the community given that AIP authors will be submitting drafts with little to no resources.
* APE Improvement Proposal Draft & Analysis Report (AIP DAR Package) - both the AIP Draft (submitted by the author) and the AIP Analysis Report (submitted by the project management team engaged by the APE Foundation) should be defined as a package after the analysis report is conducted, as they should only be considered together from that point on.
* AIP Moderation - the act of reviewing an AIP DAR Package to determine whether or not the AIP draft meets the predetermined and DAO-approved guidelines and therefore is eligible to move to the next step in the process. If an AIP DAR Package passes AIP Moderation, it becomes a Pending AIP.
* Pending AIP - the AIP status after AIP DAR, which is only reached if it passes AIP Moderation.
* Post-Moderation Tagging - the process of tagging all Pending AIPs that have successfully been through the AIP analysis report and AIP moderation phases. There are two tags given at this stage: 1) “Straight to Vote,” which is for any pending AIP where costs, content, and implications are considered to be straightforward and of no risk to the well-being of the DAO. 2) “Needs Administrative Review,” which is for any pending AIP with costs, content, or implications that are considered to be complicated or a potential risk to the well-being of the DAO and therefore must be reviewed by the Board of the DAO.
* Administrative Review - the process of evaluating pending AIPs that have been tagged as “Needs Administrative Review” to determine whether they should be halted or sent to vote by the community.
* Return for Clarification - a type of administrative classification that requires the AIP author to clarify certain information regarding the Pending AIP. This classification would be given in cases such as cost to implement being unclear, proposing to utilize a larger percentage of the Ecosystem Fund than is justified based on the value it would provide to the community, or being in direct conflict with an active AIP.
* Return for Reconstruction - a type of administrative classification that requires the proposer to restart the proposal submission process because the Pending AIP violates DAO-approved requirements, or in cases of violation of the law, reasonable suspicion of fraud or other misleading information, or the pending AIP being at odds with the mission, values, or well-being of the Foundation or DAO.
* Weekly AIP Release - every Thursday at 9PM ET, when all AIPs that are ready to go live are released together in a batch.
* Weekly Voting Close - when all AIPs in a Weekly AIP Release batch close for voting, which happens the following Wednesday at 9PM ET.
* Live AIP - an AIP that has passed all required approval stages and is launched for the community to vote on it. The voting options for a Live AIP are “In favor” and “Against.” Voting “In favor” means the voter is in favor of implementing the AIP exactly as-is. Voting “Against” means the voter is against implementing the AIP exactly as-is — voters may vote “Against” to encourage the author to resubmit the AIP after making changes.
* Final AIP - an AIP that has completed the voting process. There are two subcategories here: Accepted and Rejected.
* Implementation of Accepted AIP - the process of implementing an AIP that has been accepted by the community via a vote, based on the predetermined steps laid out in the Draft/Template and Analysis Report phases.
GENERAL GUIDELINES
1. Every year, there is a DAO-wide vote to determine which DAO members will serve on a special council on the APE Foundation (the DAO’s “Board”). The purpose of the Board is to administer DAO proposals and serve the vision of the community. This initial Board will only serve six months.
2. A Board member may be removed and replaced prior to the term’s end pursuant to a majority vote of token holders.
3. The total cost of implementation must be clear in order for a proposal to go to vote.
4. DAO members must search past proposals to ensure any idea they intend to write a proposal for has not already been submitted.
5. If a suggested proposal directly conflicts with a proposal that is currently up for vote, the second proposal should not go for a vote until a decision is made on the first proposal to avoid approval of opposing requirements.
6. A suggested proposal that directly conflicts with another approved proposal cannot go to vote for three months after the original proposal has been implemented to avoid wasting community assets.
7. Proposals will not be put up for a vote if they involve illegal activity, hate speech, pornographic material, or are at odds with the mission or values of the APE Foundation.

AIP-98: A Community-First ApeCoin DAO Marketplace Proposal


By : Zach Heerwagen (aka zheerwagen)


Proposed : August 22
Accepted : September 22


ApeCoin DAO Marketplace Proposal V2
After releasing our v1 marketplace proposal 68last week, we took a step back to digest MagicEden’s competing proposal and get feedback from the community. The last couple weeks has been inspiring, meeting new ApeCoin community members, and listening to feedback. Below you will find our updated draft, including a summary of the feedback received, how we’re adjusting, and why we’re the right builders for the job.
At the heart of this proposal is our desire to build for the community, and embrace Web3 values of decentralization via composability, non-extraction, and interoperability.
* Composability means parts of a system can be replaced and recombined so you can easily replace us as the ApeCoin DAO marketplace front end without impacting users.
* Non-extraction means not charging more than you need, we take just enough to cover operating costs and keep building so we can do our best to return value to creators.
* Interoperability means systems ability to use available data. By leveraging Reservoir0x we can both aggregate the most liquidity and make data available for aggregators and other user applications, something MagicEden has blocked on its Solana marketplace.

Abstract
A community marketplace is a natural next step for the ApeCoin DAO. A successful community marketplace will: drive adoption of $APE through $APE listings, drive traffic to the ApeCoin DAO (apecoin.com 10), and decrease fees to community members by building a APE-native marketplace with rich ape-specific user experiences. In order to compete this marketplace must be cost competitive with fees in-line with or lower than competitors like X2Y2.
Our marketplace will host all Yugaverse projects in a single marketplace UI, with dramatically reduced fees, keeping $$ in the BAYC ecosystem and improving the marketplace experience for both buyers and sellers.
While we have a lot to share, some notable key features of the marketplace are the following:
* Leveraging @reservoir0x’s open-source, on-chain orderbook to increase openness and composability.
* Aggregated orders from major marketplaces (OpenSea, LooksRare, X2Y2, Sudoswap, and more) to maintain a strong bridge to the rest of the NFT market.
* Native sales in $APE with no fees to users buying and selling in $APE.
* A .5% marketplace fee on $ETH listings and a .25% fee in $APE. .25% of all fees will be sent to a community-held multi-sig wallet on a monthly cadence. The use of funds can then be decided in a separate AIP. (more on why later) The .25% from $ETH will be converted to $APE and sent to the wallet.
* Development of contextual and ape-specific marketplace functionality, such as integration of key BAYC metadata, relation to the Otherside, and more.
About Us :
I’m Zach (Twitter 77/ LinkedIn 15) and prior to starting Snag Solutions 25I was an early leader at DoorDash. I built our early pickup and ads businesses and helped merchants like Chipotle, Papa Johns, and Panera, run their online ordering, and defined an early crypto strategy in my final months.
I red-pilled into web3 last year, and fell in love with NFTs. BAYC was my first big purchase, and I’m a BAYC/MAYC/BAKC/Otherside holder. As a holder and early believer this project is not just a business opportunity for me, but a passion project. I see a massive opportunity to keep $$ in the BAYC ecosystem, reduce fraud, and drive $APE adoption.
My co-founder Jason (Twitter 31/ LinkedIn 15) was our first merchant engineering manager at DoorDash and built both our early payments product and the carousels DoorDash still uses today. He’s one of the best developers I’ve ever worked with and loves to build for creators.
We also have three advisors, all deeply engaged BAYC/MAYC members:
* TropoFarmer (Twitter 11)
* NFTPres (Twitter 17)
* Champtgram (Twitter 17)
What We’ve Heard From The Community
We’ve spoken with a number of $APE community members over the last several weeks. There are four major topics that surfaced from our conversations. If you think we are missing anything at all, please comment so we can discuss.
1. The $APE community wants to embrace Web3 values of decentralization, non-extraction, and composability. In a dream scenario many would want to build and run the marketplace themselves, but recognize this isn’t feasible today.
2. An ApeCoin DAO marketplace must drive value for the community, but because the DAO isn’t legally set up to accept funds this is difficult to accomplish. There are four main proposals:
* Burn $APE to drive token value through scarcity.
* Fund marketplace incentives for marketplace users via tokenomics.
* Send $APE to a donor advised fund that custodies the funds in $APE for a set time before donating.
* Route money to a new ApeCoin sub-DAO that controls the funding, and is still governed by $APE token holders. This eliminates ApeCoin DAO legal complexity.
3. The volatility of $APE makes it a challenging currency to list high-priced NFT’s in due to arbitrage opportunities, but use of $APE should still be encouraged.
4. DAO members would prefer not to choose a single marketplace at this time without enabling competition. Further, there’s some concern about use of dedicated URL’s as likely to lead to more fraud.
How we’re responding
1. We’re partnering with @reservoir0x to leverage their open and on-chain orderbook. This comes with four key advantages:
* Order data is stored on Arweave, unlocking benefits from storing orders on-chain without the cost. This enables free listings and offers like users expect, but without reliance on a centralized orderbook managed in a private database. This also allows for permissionless data availability so users can build tools and data visualizations using on-chain data while removing a key centralization vector.
* Reservoir aggregates liquidity from across the ecosystem including orders from OpenSea, LooksRare, X2Y2, and more and enables order types that are unavailable in other marketplace stacks, like trait-based bidding. We’ll innovate on the BAYC marketplace front end while they build the richest on-chain NFT data repository enabling us to pull in novel features as they ship.
* Since the Reservoir orderbook is on-chain (Arweave), the marketplace could easily be replaced if the community is dissatisfied with no loss of liquidity. For this reason, we are applying for a 6-month lease on a dedicated URL pointing to our hosted experience, and will apply for 6-12 month extensions following. This creates pressure for us to add value, if the DAO ever wants to replace us you can do it without impacting listings.
* We’ll also partner with Reservoir0x to enable ERC-20 purchasing, since this functionality is already native to Reservoir, we’re eliminating our $50K request for funding so there’s no cost to the DAO.
2. Due to lack of an obvious mechanism to add value to the DAO we’re reducing our fees. Our initial proposal increased fees to fund payments directly to the DAO treasury as a new revenue stream, but because the DAO is set up as a Cayman foundation it can’t accept funding without risking being ruled a security (for now). With this in mind we reduced fees to .5% on ETH and .25% on $APE with .25% of each transaction sent to a gnosis multi-sig as $APE for future community use.
* Total fees: .25% on listings in $APE, and .5% for ETH listings, with .25% of each transaction going to the DAO so we make .25% only on $ETH transactions.
* The multi-sig will be controlled by 7 reputable & doxxed community members with use of funds to be voted on at a later date.
3. Because of strongly divided feedback across burning, incentives, and charitable contributions, we propose starting the funding stream immediately and tabling the topic for a separate AIP. This approach maintains an incentive to list in $APE via our 0% fee, and we can then explore solutions to enable listing in $ETH or $USDC with payment in $APE.
* We’re open to supporting any path chosen by the community, but want to give the DAO time to make a decision on use of funds. We’re keeping our fees low so if the DAO wants to increase the seller fee on either $ETH or $APE transactions.
* If there’s overwhelming support for the a single approach we can pivot, but our current POV is that use of funding is a critical DAO topic that should be tackled separately.
4. We’re revising our proposal to request EITHER a dedicated URL ie. marketplace.apecoin.com 26AND/OR a dedicated link from the ApeCoin DAO homepage. If the community prefers to select multiple marketplaces we’re open to being one of severa URL’s or links available. That said, we believe a single marketplace will be best for the community so we don’t split attention and liquidity.
Why Snag Solutions is the Right Partner and Where We’ll Go From Here
1. We’re experienced marketplace builders who share a vision of helping creators and communities capture value by unbundling NFT marketplaces. Our roadmap improves upon the project-specific buying experience via a multi-collection UI, linking items across collections, improving token metadata, and building social tooling.
2. We’re building project-specific marketplaces with creators and their communities in mind. Everything we’re building is project-specific. We plan to build creator first tools like private sales with no fees except for creator royalties, and can create a separate AIP to introduce this feature and help limit scams when ready.
3. We’ll keep building for the ApeCoin community and collecting feedback but will focus on the NFT marketplace without touching adjacent revenue streams and marketplace categories like IP licensing or merch marketplaces leaving opportunities for other $APE community builders. Our .25% $ETH fee will fund ongoing development and we’ll use this as a key proof case for first party marketplaces.
Finally, while fees are not the only thing that matters, we want to reiterate that we have a market ready product that we’re prepared to invest in at dramatically lower rates. Why would we let the leading Solana marketplace charge a full percent more for a similar, more centralized, offering?
More importantly, why would anyone use that marketplace with a 1%+ fee over X2Y2?
* $ETH fees:
   * ME: 1.5%, .25% discount if BAYC/MAYC
   * SNAG: .25% fee + .25% burn
* $APE fees:
   * ME: 1%, .25% discount if BAYC MAYC
   * SNAG: .25% fee + .25% burn
So to summarize:
1. We’ll build a native marketplace that hosts all Yugaverse collections with .5% on $ETH listings and .25% fees on $APE listings with an open order book solution and aggregated liquidity. .25% of each transaction will be earmarked for the DAO, and we’ll apply for renewal in 6-months.
2. All $APE fees will be routed to a community held multi-sig with use of funds to be voted on in a future AIP. This gives the DAO more time to determine how to best utilize new funding sources while taking $APE off of the market in the interim.
3. We’re experienced marketplace builders, established community members, and flexible partners incentivized to drive value for the DAO. We’ll also never host a competitive marketplace hosting Yuga collections or silo marketplace liquidity to capture value.
4. We’re entirely focused on and committed to innovating on the front end experience to make sure the ApeCoin DAO marketplace is the go-to destination for Yugaverse NFTs.
Product Specifications | Overview of Snag Tech Stack
1. Front end libraries - Next.js, Vercel
2. Reservoir0x’s aggregated liquidity and open-source + on-chain order book.
3. Light backend for social features like user profiles
Next Steps & Timeline:
1. Our partnership with Reservoir0x lets us to launch as soon as we complete the audit process.
2. We’ll complete an audit prior to supporting this level of scale and want to enable the community to determine the best auditor for the job. We’re happy to do the work to find someone reputable who fits into our timeline, or can source from the community.
Overall Cost:
No cost to the DAO.
Marketing commitments from ApeCoin DAO including:
* A 6-month lease on a dedicated URL (ie. marketplace.apecoin.com 26) pointed to our hosted experience AND/OR a link to our URL from the ApeCoin homepage. We prefer both, but will take either depending on board and community feedback.
* Twitter post(s) at launch
Closing Thoughts & Helpful Links
ApeCoin DAO is uniquely positioned to change the current dynamics of NFT marketplaces where the majority of value is captured by two marketplace providers. The $APE community deserves a dedicated marketplace for Yuga projects that is built with the collections in mind and minimally extractive. We can build this future alongside the community without concern of misaligned incentives stemming from a separate marketplace Ethereum marketplace.
Finally, a note on Magic Eden’s proposal, I’m personally supportive of any of the three other marketplace proposals and trust the community will see the centralization risk associated with a ME marketplace. 17
We look forward to hearing your feedback! Please comment or reach out via twitter 77if interested in chatting, and I’m excited to join any Ape-led spaces to share the message in the coming weeks.

AIP -1 : Proposing the DAO - Process
Category: Process
Submitted by: Cartan Group LLC
ABSTRACT
This document proposes the structure of a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) that would be governed by the holders of ApeCoin, a decentralized token that the community hopes will serve as the primary token for art, gaming, entertainment, and events in web3.
MOTIVATION
APE Foundation, which will serve the ApeCoin DAO community and be governed by it, aims to be the heart of art, gaming, entertainment, and events on the blockchain.
The ApeCoin DAO community will have the power to submit proposals, vote on the most exciting and promising ideas, and make them real.
The guiding values of APE Foundation are:
   * Boldness: We don’t shy away from the weird, the hard, or the new.
   * Equality: One APE equals one APE.
   * Transparency: Processes and decisions are shared openly with the community.
   * Collective Responsibility: We leave everything better than we found it.
   * Persistence: Success is an ouroboros, not a straight line.
RATIONALE
APE Foundation serves the ApeCoin DAO in fostering a community of creators and everyday innovators with aligning motivation and values to shape the future of web3.
The short-term vision is to facilitate the launch of the best product feasible today in a way that aligns with the DAO’s motivation and values by balancing productivity and governance with bottom-up contribution, while minimizing politics.
To achieve this, it is imperative that participating in idea submission, commentary, proposal submission, and voting is restricted to ApeCoin DAO members. Holding ApeCoin is the only requirement for membership in the DAO.
In keeping with the core APE Foundation value of transparency, all ideas and commentary in Discourse, proposals, votes cast, and voting outcomes will be publically available to view.
THE PROCESS
Phase 1: AIP Idea
   * An AIP Idea is submitted as a post in Discourse and must receive confirmation from a moderator that it complies with DAO-approved guidelines before it appears to the community.
   * The person or people submitting the AIP Idea will be referred to as the author or authors.
   * Multiple members can work together on an AIP idea, but it should be submitted only once.
   * The AIP idea informally gathers comments via Discourse.
   * Seven days after being posted in the Discourse, the community feedback process for the AIP Idea will close.
Phase 2: AIP Draft
   * Once the seven-day feedback window has passed and a moderator has closed the Discourse topic, a moderator will provide the AIP author with the appropriate template.
   * A proposal typically includes:
   * Abstract - Two or three sentences that summarize the proposal.
   * Motivation - A statement on why the APE Community should implement the proposal.
   * Rationale - An explanation of how the proposal aligns with the APE Community’s mission and guiding values.
   * Key Terms (optional) - Definitions of any terms within the proposal that are unique to the proposal, new to the APE Community, and/or industry-specific.
   * Specifications - A detailed breakdown of the platforms and technologies that will be used.
   * Steps to Implement - The steps to implement the proposal, including associated costs, manpower, and other resources for each step where applicable.
   * Timeline - Relevant timing details, including but not limited to start date, milestones, and completion dates.
   * Overall Cost - The total cost to implement the proposal.
   * The author will fill out the template based on the original AIP Idea, incorporating any feedback provided by the community that helps the idea better serve the DAO.
   * The author can add additional fields to the template if necessary to fully communicate the intentions, specifics, and implications of the AIP Draft.
   * Proposals that did not make it through the respective approval process and are being resubmitted should also include:
   * Link to original proposal
   * Reason it was not approved
   * Changes that have been made and why it should now be approved
   * Category options:
   * Core: Ecosystem Fund Allocation
   * Core: Ecosystem Fund Allocation (Resubmission)
   * Core: Brand Decision
   * Core: Brand Decision (Resubmission)
   * Process
   * Process (Resubmission)
   * Informational
   * Informational (Resubmission)
   * The moderator may then continue communication with the author to inform them of any incorrect or missing information that needs to be changed—or clarifications that need to be made—in order for the AIP Draft to comply with the DAO-approved guidelines and move to the next step.
   * If the author does not respond to a moderator’s request to change, update, or make clarifications on the AIP Draft within 30 days, the AIP Draft will be automatically rejected as having failed to comply with the DAO-approved guidelines.
   * When the moderator confirms that an AIP Draft complies with the DAO-approved guidelines, they assign a number to the AIP for identification purposes throughout the rest of the process. From this point on, the AIP is referred to as “AIP-#: (Name) - (Category)”. For example, this AIP is “AIP-1: Proposing the DAO - Process”.
Phase 3: AIP Analysis Report
   * The AIP Draft is then reviewed by a project management team engaged by APE Foundation, who will provide an in-depth AIP Analysis Report.
   * The purpose of the AIP Analysis Report is to ensure that all costs, steps to implement, legal considerations, third-party review requirements, potential conflicts of interests, and any further implications have been properly considered and identified in order to ensure the DAO members have enough information to make an informed decision.
   * This is considered to be a service for the DAO community given that AIP authors may be submitting drafts with little to no resources.
Phase 4: AIP Moderation
   * The AIP DAR Package is reviewed by a team of moderators.
   * The AIP DAR Package will either be approved or not approved based on whether it adheres to the DAO-approved guidelines.
   * If an AIP DAR Package is approved as complying with DAO-approved guidelines, it becomes a Pending AIP and moves to Phase 5.
   * If an AIP DAR Package fails to comply with DAO-approved guidelines, it is eligible for resubmission unless in cases of violation of the law or reasonable suspicion of fraud or other misleading information.
Phase 5: Post-Moderation Tagging
   * Pending AIPs that have passed AIP Moderation will then either be tagged as “Straight to Vote” or “Needs Administrative Review”’ as each term is defined and described in this Proposal.
   * The “Straight to Vote” tag is given for any pending AIP whose costs, content, and implications are considered to be straightforward and of no risk to the well-being of the DAO. Any Pending AIP that is tagged as “Straight to Vote” will skip to Phase 7.
   * The “Needs Administrative Review” tag is given for any pending AIP whose costs, content, or implications are considered to be complicated or a potential risk to the well-being of the DAO. Any Pending AIP that is tagged as “Needs Administrative Review” must go through Phase 6.
Phase 6: Administrative Review
   * This phase is only for Pending AIPs that have been tagged with “Needs Administrative Review.”
   * When this happens, the Board, serving in an administrative capacity, will determine whether further action is required prior to a Pending AIP proceeding to Phase 7.
   * Pending AIPs that the Board determines do not require additional action will be tagged as “Approved for Voting” and proceed to Phase 7.
   * If the Board decides to return a Pending AIP for further clarification or action, they must provide a clear explanation of why and tag it as either “Return for Reconstruction” or “Return for Clarification.”
   * Reasons to tag as “Return for Reconstruction” or “Return for Clarification” may include but are not limited to:
   * Cost to implement unclear/not able to be calculated (tagged as “Return for Clarification”)
   * Proposes to use more than 5% of the Ecosystem Fund (tagged as “Return for Clarification”)
   * Conflicts with another proposal (tagged as “Return for Clarification”)
   * Proposal is at odds with the mission/values of the DAO (tagged as “Return for Reconstruction”)
   * Proposal is at odds with the well-being of the DAO (tagged as “Return for Reconstruction”)
   * Violations of law, or against advice of counsel for APE Foundation (tagged as “Return for Reconstruction”)
   * Reasonable suspicion of fraud or other misleading information (tagged as “Return for Reconstruction”)
Phase 7: Live AIP
   * Drafts that have passed their respective approval processes will become a Live AIP on Snapshot during the next Weekly AIP Release, which is when new AIPs are released in batches every Thursday at 9PM ET.
   * Moderators are the only ones that can post AIPs to Snapshot because they must ensure that each one has gone through the correct approvals process.
   * Once live on Snapshot, Live AIPs are open to voting until Weekly Voting Close, which is when all Live AIPs from a given batch close for voting at 9PM ET on the Wednesday following their release.
   * The voting options are “In favor” and “Against.” Voting “In favor” means the voter is in favor of implementing the AIP exactly as-is. Voting “Against” means the vote is against implementing the AIP exactly as-is — voters may vote “Against” to encourage the author to resubmit the AIP after making changes.
Phase 8: Final AIP
   * If by the Vote Close Time the Live AIP has not gotten any votes or is tied, it will be tagged as “Stalled” and be eligible for Resubmission.
   * In all other cases, after the Vote Close Time, Live AIPs are moved to Final AIPs.
   * There are two subcategories for the Final AIP status: accepted and rejected.
   * Rejected Final AIPs will have the chance to be resubmitted via the appropriate Resubmission Template if the author contacts a moderator to initiate this process.
   * Accepted Final AIPs will move into implementation.
Phase 9: Implementation
   * For Accepted Final AIPs, implementation will begin based on the steps outlined in the AIP template.
   * The project management team engaged by the APE Foundation is responsible for making sure this happens but not responsible for doing it themselves.
   * The AIP implementation is administered by the Ape Foundation. Implementation may be immaterially or materially altered to optimize for security, usability, to protect APE holders, and otherwise to effect the intent of the AIP. Any material deviations from an AIP, as initially approved, will be disclosed to the APE holder community.
SPECIFICATIONS
   * DAO Hub: APE Foundation website, which will provide an interface to educate DAO members on the governance process and provide easy access to the channels described below in order to streamline the DAO’s operation and enhance its utility.
   * Communication Channel: Discourse (Phase 1)
   * ApeCoin holders must go through a wallet authentication process to post ideas or give feedback to ideas via comments.
   * AIP Idea posts must be approved by a moderator to ensure it meets all predetermined guidelines and template requirements.
   * All posts and comments will be regularly monitored by both a team of community managers engaged by the APE Foundation and by the DAO community members themselves. There will be zero tolerance for hate speech anywhere on this platform.
   * The author of an idea via a post in Discourse cannot edit the original post. If the author wants to propose changes to the original idea, the author must do this via the comments.
   * Seven (7) days after it has been posted, ideas become closed to community feedback and will be locked by a moderator or community manager.
   * Process for Draft Submission via Template: (Phase 2)
   * Once an idea is locked in Discourse after the seven-day community feedback period, a moderator will contact the author to provide the appropriate template.
   * The author should then submit an official AIP draft to the moderator using the template.
   * The moderator may then continue communication with the author to inform them of any incorrect or missing information that needs to be changed—or clarifications that need to be made— for the AIP Draft to move to the next step.
   * If the author does not respond to a moderator’s request to change, update, or make clarifications on the AIP Draft within 30 days, the AIP Draft will be automatically rejected.
   * Platform where Live AIPs are Hosted: Snapshot (Phase 7)
   * ApeCoin holders must go through a wallet authentication process to vote on Snapshot.
   * Moderators are the only ones allowed to launch AIPs on Snapshot as they must ensure each AIP has gone through the correct approval process.
   * See AIP-2 for further details.

AIP - 2 : Voting - Process
Category: Process
Author: Cartan Group LLC
ABSTRACT
This document proposes the voting protocol for the DAO outlined in AIP-1.
MOTIVATION
The main motivation behind this proposal is to create the voting infrastructure for ApeCoin holders to participate in the decision-making of the DAO, the governing body of the Foundation. The core criteria for the proposed voting system are:
   * not requiring gas payment
   * ensuring transparency
   * expanding governance participation to all holders of ApeCoin
One of the goals of launching a token was to facilitate decentralized community governance in the form of the ApeCoin DAO. Without a voting system in place, arriving at consensus on proposals would be centralized, with only a few people holding decision-making abilities. This proposal aims to avoid this result.
RATIONALE
As the ecosystem evolves and expands, a well-defined system is required to gather new community ideas and provide a clear path for these ideas to be approved for implementation. A proposal process is foundational to this system becoming a reality.
A proposal process, however, needs an accompanying consensus mechanism. It must be fair, transparent, and low-cost to place votes. Balancing each of these requirements is challenging. On-chain solutions make it costly to vote. Off-chain solutions, like the one proposed, are less expensive, but require actions to take place off chain.
This proposal outlines a voting protocol that seeks to balance the pros and cons of various voting approaches, and to hold up the core APE Foundation guiding values of equality and transparency. This voting protocol can be found below in the following SPECIFICATIONS section.
SPECIFICATIONS
Assuming the approval of AIP-1, implement Snapshot as the voting mechanism / protocol where:
   * Only ApeCoin token holders may vote
   * Token holders will have the ability to delegate votes
   * New proposals that meet the required guidelines will be launched in batches every Thursday at 9PM ET
   * The voting opens immediately upon launch
   * The voting options for a Live AIP are “In favor” and “Against.” Voting “In favor” means the voter is in favor of implementing the AIP exactly as-is. Voting “Against” means the vote is against implementing the AIP exactly as-is — one may vote “Against” to encourage the author to resubmit the AIP after making changes.
   * The voting for each proposal in each weekly batch will be open for voting for six days, closing at 9PM ET on the following Wednesday
   * Proposals that are approved by the holders of the requisite number of ApeCoin are moved to the APE Foundation for implementation
   * Only moderators can post AIPs to Snapshot because they must ensure that each one has gone through the correct approvals process
STEPS TO IMPLEMENT
   * Purchased ENS domain
   * Created specific space on Snapshot
   * Implemented ecosystem-specific voting strategy
   * Set administrator addresses
   * Set voting rules
   * Set restrictions in Snapshot so that only moderators can launch proposals
   * Opened ratification of AIP-1 and AIP-2

AIP - 3 : Year 1 Budgets - Ecosystem Fund Allocation


Category: Core - Ecosystem Fund Allocation
Author: Cartan Group LLC


ABSTRACT : 
This document proposes the APE Foundation's budget for March 17, 2022 until December 31, 2022, which as outlined below allocates up to 6% of the total APE Ecosystem Fund, for events, game development, education, marketing, and merch.


MOTIVATION : 
The main motivation behind this proposal is to set up the APE Ecosystem for success in year 1. We propose using 6% of the total APE Ecosystem Fund on four foundational spending categories. DAO members will vote throughout the year on the specific proposals within each category. The amount proposed for each category is being recommended to accelerate adoption, adequately support projects and collaborations, and create opportunities for ROl in year 1.


RATIONALE : 
It is essential to launch the DAO with an Ecosystem Fund that is set up to maximize funds, create opportunities for growth, and support the long-term operation of the DAO. This proposal seeks to do that by setting aside a foundational budget of 6% for the following categories.
Up to 3.2% of the Ecosystem Fund for game development: This makes it possible to partner with game developers ranging from top-tier studios to indies, creating games and providing in-game incentives that bring the APE community to the forefront of web3 gaming. This also provides a potential opportunity to generate funds for the benefit of the APE Ecosystem.
Up to 1.2% of the Ecosystem Fund for events: This allows for the execution of virtual and IRL events that have high engagement, strengthen the community, and reflect our mission to serve the community and drive web3 culture forward.
Up to .8% of the Ecosystem Fund for merch production: This allows for merch launches of high-quality products that tie into other APE Ecosystem projects and, in cases of merch that must be purchased, generates funds for the Ecosystem Fund.
Up to .5% of the Ecosystem Fund for education and marketing: This will support initiatives and partnerships that can grow the user base beyond the current APE community and early adopters. The more adoption there is, the more the community can do in the short-term and long-term future.
Up to .3% of the Ecosystem Fund for development of an ApeCoin NFT marketplace: This allows for the creation of a decentralized NFT marketplace, subject to advice from counsel, where creators can set their own secondary fee, and the marketplace's commission fee will feed back into the Ecosystem Fund.

AIP- 9: Boring Security


Category: Core - Ecosystem Fund Allocation
Author: Feld4014 & Boring Security - www.boringsecurity.com 47
ABSTRACT
This document outlines the Boring Security Mission statement and alignment with the greater BAYC and NFT community. In order to grow the pie, we must first secure the crust, and protect the gooey insides from malicious actors.
MOTIVATION
The Boring Security DAO has tracked over $50mm worth of hacked/scammed NFTs in the space and has attributed it largely to lack of awareness and education on the NFT communities’ part. There have been no large-scale vendor neutral efforts in the space to educate, inform, and provide timely updates such that the community can make better informed risk decisions with their capital and NFTs.
RATIONALE
With BAYC holders being the largest target for hackers/scammers, the DAO will face unique challenges over the coming months and years as it pertains to Security. Bringing a whole slew of new users into DeFi primitives, they will face even more challenges in ensuring the safety of their coins, NFTs, and digital assets more broadly. As the ecosystem evolves and web3 integrations become more prevalent, getting a BAYC holder to sign a potentially malicious transaction will be the holy grail of exploits, and one that should concern this DAO greatly.
Boring Security: A Security Utility for the NFT community and beyond
Overall Cost:
We are requesting 6969 apecoin to help facilitate our first 3-6 months of operations. This fund will be used to compensate volunteers and contributors towards DAO efforts using coordinape. The Coordinape Circle “Boring Security” that will govern DAO compensation and our ‘deliverables’ channel in Discord will be auditable by all members of the Bored. The allocations of apecoin will be voted on by contributors (a small list of core contributors are listed above).

PROPOSAL NAME
BORED AIP: Bringing Order and Reliability via Ecosystem Decentralization
PROPOSAL CATEGORY
Ecosystem Fund Allocation
ABSTRACT
The expiration of the APE Foundation’s administrator contract for the second time in 2022 has magnified the need to develop internal capabilities and avoid reliance on any external resource that could result in a single point of failure in the DAO. This AIP represents progress over perfection – the only thing possible in this messy and amazing world of decentralized governance we love.
Compared to the costs of the previous version of this proposal – the above expenses represent a savings to the DAO of $372,812 over the 3-month period. It’s important to note that there will be other expenses related to WG0, but their allocation will be based fully on specific budget requests made by WG0 Stewards and subject to the approval of the Special Council.

MOTIVATION
 Summary
The problem:
   1. Per AIP-113, the current APE Foundation administrator contract expires December 31, 2022
   2. There is an imperative need to maintain continuity and compliance of APE Foundation operations
   3. ApeCoin DAO does not currently have the organizational structure or capabilities to execute any internal operations
The solution:
   1. Extend contract with current APE Foundation administrator (Cartan Group, LLC.) two months to maintain continuity and compliance
   2. Implement a transparent Request for Proposals (“RFP”) process to identify future APE Foundation administrators during the extension period (January 1 - February 28, 2022). If necessary, complete handover to future DAO administrator
   3. Form interim working group composed of key DAO stakeholders tasked with developing DAO working group structures and internal capabilities
RATIONALE
 Summary
Along with implementing a transparent RFP process to find the next APE Foundation administrator, we’re motivated to further the decentralization of the DAO by creating a working group composed of key stakeholders. These stakeholders are community members who have shown commitment to the DAO through either participation in the governance process or willingness to hold significant amounts of $APE and all their voices are valuable in determining the future of ApeCoin DAO.
When we create a foundational and operational alignment of the stakeholders within this working group, we will further realize our core mission to serve as a more decentralized protocol layer for community-led initiatives that drive culture forward into the metaverse and continue to actively support the growth of the $APE ecosystem.
We have avoided granular specificity in this proposal for one very simple reason – we don’t know what we don’t know. Until we’re able to get under the hood with the current DAO administrator we won’t have a clear understanding of all the tasks we’re about to undertake. That is why we’ve established a clear way to assemble our first official working group of key stakeholders, who will then have a per wallet vote on the direction of the DAO for an intentionally short 3-month period, that will give us the structure and capabilities we need to take on any challenges we face in the future.
To summarize, it’s imperative to note that there are certain roles and responsibilities that a Cayman Foundation Administrator must legally fill for the ApeCoin DAO. The current DAO Administrator (Cartan) is filling those roles as well as items that are out of their initial scope of work. The aim of creating working groups is to fill in the areas that are out of scope for the current DAO Administrator (Cartan) and any future Administrators of the ApeCoin DAO going forward.


KEY TERMS
 Summary
   1. Working Group: A working group is a group of individuals who have come together to work on a specific task or project. Working groups are typically formed to address a specific issue or problem, and they often have a specific goal or objective in mind. Members of a working group may be experts in a particular field or may represent different perspectives and viewpoints. Working groups are often used in organizations to facilitate collaboration and problem-solving, and they may be composed of employees, volunteers, or a combination of both. Working groups may be temporary or permanent, and they may be formally established by an organization or informally created by a group of individuals.
   2. Stakeholder / Key Stakeholder: Community members who have met any of the three following requirements:
a. ApeCoin DAO members who have achieved Trust Level Status 2 (Member) or higher on ApeCoin Discourse (the Official communication platform for DAO functions) on or before December 21, 2022; or
b. $APE holders who have voted on at least 50% of the AIPs that have gone to Snapshot; or
c. $APE holders with 50,000 APE or more in voting power on or before December 21, 2022.
   3. Working Group Zero (or “WG0”): WG0 is an interim working group in ApeCoin DAO with a 3-month mandate to decentralize and operationalize the DAO. WG0 is composed of key stakeholders who have shown commitment to the DAO through either participation in the governance process or willingness to hold significant amounts of $APE and all their voices are valuable in determining the future of ApeCoin DAO. Along with specific operational tasks, WG0 will propose Official ApeCoin DAO Working Groups that will assume the responsibilities of WG0 upon the expiration of its mandate.
   4. Official ApeCoin DAO Working Groups: Official ApeCoin DAO Working Groups will be proposed by WG0 and serve to decentralize and operationalize DAO functions.
   5. Focus Groups: WG0 members will be expected to organize into focus groups based on particular domain expertise amongst the membership of WG0.
a. Priority focus groups will be Operations, Governance, and Communications in order to effectively execute against the mandate of WG0.
b. As subject matter experts, lead participants of any working groups currently approved by AIP, or in AIP Draft status, will form the core membership focus groups in their specific domain, if they so desire, for the duration of WG0. E.g. Boring Security, will form the core of the Security Focus Group, ApeComms will form the core of the Communications Focus Group, IRL Events will form the core of the Events Focus Group, et al.
c. Additional focus groups will convene around any specific domains as desired by the members of WG0.
d. The above does not preclude any WG0 participants from participating in any domain specific focus group.
   6. Steward: A total of seven members who serve Working Group Zero on behalf of the DAO. They perform administrative oversight, are responsible for budgeting based on the needs of WG0 as approved by the Special Council, and they are responsible for reporting on all WG0 activities between the Special Council, the Administrators, and the Community during the 3-month mandate of WG0.
   7. Steward Election Window / Election Window: The period between January 7th and January 14th in which WG0 will elect four of the seven total Stewards of WG0.
SPECIFICATIONS
DAO Administrator Functions Under 2-month Extension:
 Summary
      1. Cartan Group LLC (“Cartan”) will continue to provide APE Foundation administration services as initially detailed in AIP-1 then extended in AIP-113, for the period January 1, 2023 - February 28, 2023.
      2. Cartan will assist the interim ApeCoin DAO working group (“Working Group Zero” or “WG0”) in determining and transitioning all functions that don’t explicitly require a Cayman foundation administrator to the DAO on a schedule as determined by WG0. WG0, in consultation with the Special Council of the APE Foundation, will determine which tasks explicitly require a Cayman foundation administrator.
      3. Cartan will assist WG0 in running a transparent RFP process to elect the next DAO administrator by sharing all relevant information related to the administration of the APE Foundation with WG0. Cartan is not precluded from submitting a proposal under the RFP process that will be evaluated on its merit along with all other applicants.
      4. Cartan will assist WG0 in transitioning APE Foundation administration to the next administrator in the case that they are not willing or elected to serve as the APE Foundation administrator following the conclusion of the RFP process.
Interim Working Group Functions Under 3-month Mandate:
 Summary
      1. Working Group Zero will determine and submit a budget to the Special Council on a monthly basis for approval to execute the functions transitioned from the current APE Foundation administrator and complete the additional functions listed below during the 3-month interim period. The first month’s budget will be pre-approved up to US$44,710 in order to be able to begin executing immediately upon the start of the interim term January 4, 2023. WG0 will review budget requests weekly with the Special Council throughout the interim term. Any money not allocated to expenses approved by the Special Council during the interim term will be returned to the APE Foundation.
      2. WG0 will determine and transition all functions that don’t explicitly require a Cayman foundation administrator to the DAO on a schedule as determined by WG0. Due to the corporate structure of the APE Foundation it is not legal for WG0 to take on all of the responsibilities of any Cayman foundation administrator.
      3. WG0 will run a transparent RFP process to elect the next DAO administrator in Q1 2023.
      4. WG0 will propose recommendations for the extension or evolution of AIP-1 prior to its next expiration.
      5. WG0 will propose future Official ApeCoin DAO Working Group guidelines and objectives via AIP that will also delegate all WG0 responsibilities to said working groups by the end of the 3-month term and dissolve.
STEPS TO IMPLEMENT
DAO Administration
 Summary
The APE Foundation will contract Cartan Group, LLC. for the 2-month period January 1, 2023 through February 28, 2023 under the specifications listed above in “DAO Administrator Functions Under 2-month Extension.”
Interim Working Group
 Summary
The work-related activities of the ApeCoin DAO should take place within decentralized working groups. The future working groups will each have a specific focus area, budget and mandate, aligned with the needs, mission statement, and guiding values of the ApeCoin DAO.
This proposal will create an interim working group, tentatively named Working Group Zero, with a conceptual mandate of operationalizing the DAO, empowering and rewarding community members for domain expertise and work on DAO operations, while taking further steps towards decentralizing the DAO in order to eliminate single points of failure in core DAO operations.
This AIP establishes Working Group Zero as a 3-month trial under the specifications listed above in, “Interim Working Group Functions Under 3-month Mandate” to assess the effectiveness of the initial working group structure so we can iterate and improve as necessary.
Key Stakeholders Eligible to Participate in Working Group Zero:
 Summary
To ensure participants in the working group have the necessary prior experience and skin in the game with ApeCoin DAO we propose the following eligibility criteria:
      1. ApeCoin DAO members who have achieved Trust Level Status 2 (Member) or higher on ApeCoin Discourse (the Official communication platform for DAO functions) on or before December 21, 2022; or
      2. $APE holders who have voted on at least 50% of the AIPs that have gone to Snapshot; or
      3. $APE holders with 50,000 APE or more in voting power and have voted on at least one AIP on or before December 21, 2022.
Stewards:
 Summary
A total of seven members who serve within Working Group Zero on behalf of the DAO.
      1. Stewards are responsible for:
a. Administrative oversight
b. Budgeting based on the needs of WG0 as approved by the Special Council
c. Reporting on all WG0 activities between the Special Council, the Administrators, and the Community.
      2. The APE Foundation Special Council will appoint three Stewards from amongst ApeCoin DAO members who have achieved Trust Level Status 3 (Regular) on ApeCoin Discourse on or before December 21, 2022, to lead the priority focus groups – Operations, Governance, Communications.
a. The purpose of this appointment is to be able to have resources in place to hit the ground running immediately upon the commencement of this interim mandate.
b. While the Special Council will appoint the first three Stewards, they will not be eligible to vote in the election of the remaining four Stewards.
      3. WG0 will elect the four remaining Stewards from amongst WG0 participants in a process to be completed no later than January 14, 2023, detailed below.
      4. Prior to taking their position as a Steward in WG0, all potential Stewards must pass AML and KYC checks. These are the same checks that anyone running for Special Council had to pass.
      5. Special Council members cannot serve in the position of Steward.
Steward Elections:
 Summary
To ensure the integrity of Steward elections, a Snapshot Space will be set up by the authors of this AIP with the “Whitelist” strategy listed here: https://docs.snapshotx.xyz/protocol/voting-strategies#whitelist11
         1. Authors of this AIP will publish a post titled: “WG0: A Call for Contributors” in the General category on Discourse which formally asks the community to register their interest in either voting during WG0 elections, or becoming a Steward of WG0.
a. All members of WG0 are eligible to vote during the election window for Stewards, but those members qualifying through the Trust Level 2 Discourse criteria will need to provide their ETH Address to the author of “WG0: A Call for Contributors” in order to have their address included in the Snapshot Space before January 7th, 2023.
         2. Authors of this AIP will gather the ETH addresses in the following ways:
a. A historical snapshot of holders of APE on Dec 21st with 50,000 or more in voting power who have voted on at least one AIP.
b. A historical snapshot of holders of APE on Dec 21st that have voted on 50% or more of all AIPs.
c. The authors will request ETH addresses from all participants in Trust Level 2 or above who wish to vote or run for Steward. This list will be used to verify that a user registering their interest is eligible to participate and vote on the Steward elections.
         3. Stewards may be removed at any time by:
a. A two-thirds majority vote among WG0, with the outcome of the vote communicated in the ApeCoin DAO governance forum.
b. Stewards may step down from their position at any time by communicating their intention to step down in the ApeCoin DAO governance forum.
         4. In the event that a Steward is removed, steps down, or is unable to continue as a Steward, for whatever reason, any temporary vacant positions will be filled by a contributor within WG0, as voted on by WG0.
TIMELINE
 Summary
If approved, this AIP shall go into effect January 4, 2023 for a time period of 3 months.
            * The three Stewards for the Operations, Governance, and Communications focus groups within WG0 will be selected by the Special Council on January 4, 2023.
            * The window in which members of the community can register their interest in voting on Steward elections and be registered as a voter on the Snapshot Space is January 6, 2023.
            * The election window for WG0 Stewards will be live on a TBA custom Snapshot Space January 7, 2023 until January 14, 2023.

OVERALL COSTS
 Summary
The monthly cost for DAO Administrative Functions under this AIP are as below. All amounts are denominated in USD and payable in ApeCoin based on the previous 30-day average exchange rate. Any expenses beyond what are described below will not be allocated to Working Group Zero without approval of the Special Council:


Operating Expenses for WG0 (Jan 2023 - March 2023) : $ 162,000 
Compared to the costs of the previous version of this proposal – the above expenses represent a savings to the DAO of $372,812 over the 3-month period.

AIP-183: Cartan’s Proven Track Record & Continued Commitment to Advancing the ApeCoin Ecosystem


Proposal Name: Cartan’s Proven Track Record & Continued Commitment to Advancing the ApeCoin Ecosystem
Proposal Category: Ecosystem Fund Allocation
ABSTRACT
Cartan Group LLC ("Cartan " or “we”), trusted and invited by the launch contributors, was elected by the community to administer the governance process for Ape Improvement Proposals ("AIPs ”) and the voting process, as outlined in AIP-1 and AIP-2, respectively.
Over the past 8 months, we’ve had the opportunity to serve the community and push forward the DAO’s long-term vision. We have talked to thousands of community members, made new friends, and have had an amazing time collaborating with everyone (more on Cartan’s initial scope of DAO operations and key accomplishments to date in Rationale Section below).
We have worked continuously to match the momentum and keep the workflow moving, which meant taking on additional responsibilities that were not part of the original scope. Ultimately, things needed to be done, so we rolled up our sleeves and delivered, and through operating this way, and listening to the community, we have connected with the nuances of what community members want delivered (more on expansion of scope of DAO operations and key accomplishments to date in Rationale Section below).


AUTHOR & TEAM DESCRIPTION
My name is Brian Tang and I am one of the co-founders of Cartan. My profiles are provided below:
            * LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/b4tang/ 43
            * Twitter: https://twitter.com/b4tang 49
Cartan is a full-service financial technology management consulting firm that specializes in providing operational and executive governance of foundation companies for crypto industry projects. We provide operational and administration governance services for clients looking to build sophisticated cloud-based communities.
Cartan has experience delivering multi-billion-dollar communities, professionally administering well-managed DAOs, and working with regulators to develop a comprehensive framework for fintech companies looking to operate in a stable, leading offshore jurisdiction. Administering and operating a DAO is a specialised skillset that requires expertise across engineering, finance, social media management, treasury management, governance, marketing, communications, and policy development.
MOTIVATION
This AIP outlines more accurately the roles, functions, responsibilities and ambitions that have been and will continue to be carried out by Cartan over the next year to better reflect the responsibilities and commitment necessary to administer the DAO properly.
The main goal of the next year is to expand our community of ApeCoin holders and work through a phased approach that realises ongoing improvements for the ApeCoin community.
By offering the most engaged community members jobs with a proper training, reporting structure, accountability, benefits and bonuses, we will expand the community moderation team.
Through the expansion of the community moderation team, we will propose amendments and adjustments to the AIP process for community review and approval that would be intended to work more efficiently and transparently. This includes having all interactions between the analysis team and the author be fully public for all to see. We will also investigate and implement a soft support level within Discourse to verify the community actually wants to see an AIP go to vote to reduce the unnecessary use of community resources and administration of putting something up for vote that the community does not support.
As well, putting together an AIP is a daunting effort for the author or project team. In an effort to help every author answer the question, “how does this grow the APE ecosystem?”, Cartan will deploy an analysis team who will help AIP authors create well-structured business models, with a proper risk identification model and revenue model.
In addition, Cartan will publish quarterly Transparency Reports for the Foundation, which includes but is not limited to details regarding the Foundation’s financial position, cashflows, grants funded and updated budget. The first Transparency Report was published.


RATIONALE
The Foundation is the steward of ApeCoin and the ApeCoin DAO members, and its primary goal is to promote a diverse and self-sustaining ecosystem. The Foundation uses the Ecosystem Fund to meet its objectives and follows an approved governance process to distribute these funds.
While ApeCoin DAO members can make their voices heard through the voting process, the Foundation is ultimately a legal entity that requires a team to carry out its functions. These functions include facilitating decentralised and community-led governance, administering the decisions of the ApeCoin DAO, and being responsible for day-to-day administration, bookkeeping, project management, and other operational tasks that ensure community ideas have the support they need to become a reality.
Initial Scope of DAO Operations
According to the approved AIP-1, Cartan was originally elected to provide the following functions for the community:
            * To provide operational support and project management support for the Foundation;
            * To act as the team of moderators, administrators, and lead in Discourse;
            * To act as the team of reviewers to prepare reports and any other supporting documentation necessary; and
            * Manage Discourse and Snapshot.
Expanded Scope of DAO Operations and Key Accomplishments to Date
Cartan has worked continuously to match the growing momentum of the community and the DAO. As a result, since taking on the role, we have instead provided the following functions for Foundation and the community:
1. Manage the AIP governance process
Cartan is responsible for:
            * Providing operational support and project management support for the Foundation.
            * Acting as the team of moderators, administrators, and lead in Discourse.
            * Acting as the team of reviewers to prepare reports and any other supporting documentation necessary.


Key accomplishments:
            * Set-up Discourse and configured settings, categories, and use to purposely fit the AIP governance process.
            * Built token gating solution in Discourse to ensure discussions are held by and between ApeCoin community members.
            * Set-up Snapshot Space including but not limited to voting strategies, approved authors, and general information.
            * Administered Discourse for over 6200 total users, over 500 active users in the last 30 days, and over 22,000 posts.
            * Administered 181 AIP Ideas and a total of 455 topics in Discourse.

STEPS TO IMPLEMENT
Cartan would continue to carry out all the functions under the Expanded Scope of DAO Operationswithin the Rationale section, specifically:
            1. Manage the AIP governance process
            2. Administrative reporting and insight
            3. Direct communications strategy
            4. Ecosystem grant funding and activity
            5. Corporate operations
TIMELINE
If approved, this AIP shall go into effect 1 January 2023 for a time period of 12 months.
OVERALL COSTS
The community approved fees for the Initial Scope of DAO Operations were US$150,000 per month.
In order to address the Expanded Scope of DAO Operations, the monthly costs for this AIP is US$250,000 + 20,000 ApeCoin.
The reason for the split cost (between US$ and ApeCoin) is that we know it is important that we fully align with the community and commit to growing the ApeCoin ecosystem, thereby increasing demand, which is beneficial to all.
Final result : Voting on snapshot
This proposal got voted overwhelmingly against with 77.38% voting against AIP 183 (dated December, 2022) 
AIP-239: Working Group Guidelines & The Governance Working Group
Charter


Proposal Category :
Process


Abstract : 
The goal of this AIP is to operationalize the ApeCoin DAO through autonomous Working Groups, beginning with the Governance Working Group which will allow our community to continue the DAO approved governance process which allows for the suggestion, discussion, voting and implementation of proposals. This will empower members of the DAO to make meaningful contributions and participate in facilitating governance operations, in order to further decentralize key functions of the DAO. Working Groups enable a sustainable infrastructure which will allow the DO to operate efficiently while adapting to any challenges.


Here are the FAQ’s : 
What do we believe in?
            * Creating Working Groups will help facilitate the grant process, create opportunities for DAO members, and further decentralize our DAO.
            * Long-term goal is to remove reliance on the APE Foundation and create a fully decentralized and sustainable DAO
            * Paving a clear path for community members to participate, contribute, and be rewarded for their contributions to ApeCoin DAO.
            * Paying ApeCoin DAO employees competitively for their work in the DAO.


Where are the other Working Groups? 


            * The Treasury Working Group Charter 
            * The Marketing and Communications Working Group
            * The Metaverse Working Group Charter


What does this AIP do?
            * It creates a process to create, operate, and dissolve Working Groups.
            * It creates the Governance Working Group, which will facilitate the Discourse AIP Administration process & help the DAO elect Stewards for all other working groups
            * It creates the Ape Assembly, an evolution of Working Group Zero that allows high context DAO members – whether through sweat equity, voting participation, or large $APE holdings – to be meaningfully involved in the decisions that affect the future of ApeCoin DAO including:
            * Steward Elections
            * Governance committees like Ethics, Compensation, Judicial
            * Other global DAO issues as decided by the Ape Assembly members
            * It appoints @Amplify, the lead author of this AIP, as the first Steward of the Governance Working Group to keep DAO governance moving forward until the two additional Stewards of the Governance Working Group can be elected by the DAO in June
            * It appoints @RedVulkan as the DAO Secretary until the Ape Assembly holds another election for DAO Secretary
            * It funds the Governance Working Group for an interim period of 4 months at a cost of $180,000 total. In August a new budget will be proposed and voted on by the DAO
What doesn’t this AIP do?
            * This AIP does not change the existing AIP processes established in AIP-1.
            * This AIP does not restrict someone from proposing an AIP of their own via the normal AIP-1 process which follows the Proposal process and template mentioned earlier.
How Can I Get Involved?


            * Working Groups provide an opportunity for members with domain expertise or just interest to help fulfill Initiatives that support each Working Group Charter.
            * DAO members can propose ideas that become funded Initiatives within Working Groups
            * DAO members can propose Working Groups
            * The Ape Assembly provides an opportunity for every high-context DAO member to get involved with the governance process in a meaningful way.
Why is this such an involved process?
            * Building an infrastructure to operationalize the DAO is complicated so that the end result can be easy.
            * Months of research, many conversations with other DAO leads, and well over 50 hours of discussion with our community shaped this proposal
            * The end result will be that the DAO can more efficiently manage its governance process and day-to-day operations while allowing any DAO member the chance to participate in Working Groups or propose their own ideas to make the DAO work better, including up to proposing new Working Groups


Are all of the Stewards elected by the Ape Assembly?
            * No, only the Stewards of the proposed Marketing and Communications, Treasury, and Metaverse working groups would be elected this way. The Stewards for the Governance Working group are elected through a DAO wide vote.


Summary Taxonomy
The goal of this AIP is to operationalize the ApeCoin DAO through autonomous Working Groups, beginning with the Governance Working Group. This will empower members of the DAO to make meaningful contributions and participate in facilitating governance operations, in order to further decentralize key functions of the DAO. Meanwhile creating a sustainable infrastructure which will allow the DAO to govern efficiently and fluidly adapt to any challenges.


            * operationalize the ApeCoin DAO
            * This means the DAO will have the internal resources to facilitate DAO operations and gives ApeCoin holders the power to elect employees to fulfill important roles in the day-to-day operations of the organization
            * The priority goal is to eliminate any single points of failure in DAO operations and conduct DAO business more efficiently
            * For the Governance Working Group in particular, it creates paid roles for three Stewards and a DAO Secretary. It also provides an operations fund to allow the Stewards to pay community members and others with domain expertise to help accomplish the Governance Working Group Charter without the DAO constantly having to vote on every expenditure
            * As structured, beginning in August, the DAO will vote every six months on budgets for the Working Groups to serve as a check and balance system for Working Group spending and a chance to measure OKR
            * autonomous Working Groups
            * Working Groups that function independently of each other are one of the core components of successfully decentralized DAO structures
            * The DAO will still be responsible for all the working groups, but each working group will be responsible for its own charter and operations
            * Governance Working Group
            * The Governance Working Group is the heart of ApeCoin DAO’s governance process.
            * The initial focus of the Governance Working Group will be to elect Stewards for all other Working Groups (the next 3 to be proposed are Metaverse, Marketing & Communications, and Treasury) and facilitate the Discourse AIP Administration process
            * empower members of the DAO to make meaningful contributions
            * Currently the only way to affect any change in ApeCoin DAO governance is to propose an AIP, which will then be voted upon by the community. While this is great for many things, small grant asks, common-sense fixes, and meaningful collaboration is complicated in the current system
            * participate in facilitating governance operations
            * The Governance Working Group will facilitate the Discourse AIP Administration process, allowing the Stewards to hire from the community to manage this important piece of our governance process
            * further decentralize key functions of the DAO
            * After dealing with the fallout of an unplanned change to our Cayman Islands foundation administrator it became apparent that the more operational functions that can be handled by our community the better
            * Allowing the DAO to create redundancy and eliminate single points of failure is key to further decentralizing and strengthening our ecosystem
            * fluidly adapt to any challenges
            * The working group structure is setup to adapt to any challenges that arise, any DAO member can propose an AIP to improve this structure any time after three months of operation




Other Working Group Charters:
            1. Treasury: Working Group Charter - The Treasury Working Group’s Mandate is to: “Explore legal and governance structures that would enable the DAO to sustain operations and Initiatives in perpetuity.

            2. Metaverse: Working Group Charter - The Metaverse Working Group’s Mandate is to: “Drive culture forward into the metaverse by actively supporting metaverse-related efforts within the ApeCoin DAO.”
            3. Marketing and Communications: Working Group Charter - The Marketing and Communications Working Group’s Mandate is to: “Create a consistent and compelling brand strategy and identity for the ApeCoin DAO, develop and implement comprehensive marketing and communications strategies, and establish a strong presence through effective global communication efforts in order to onboard more users into the DAO.”

Working Group Zero Stewards - @adventurousape, @Amplify, @badteeth, @Halina.eth, @Lost, @Vulkan, @Waabam


Reflection Period
Three months after each election cycle, DAO members will have the opportunity to purposefully reflect on the effectiveness of this structure and propose meaningful changes, including addressing the effectiveness of elections for Stewards of Working Groups.
During Reflection Periods, Stewards will publish proposed changes to the Working Group structure and a set of governance proposals aimed at addressing the feedback received in the previous cycle if needed.
Any point after three months from passing, any community member may also propose changes to the Working Group structure through our AIP process.
Motivation
This proposal lays the framework which will allow the DAO to make progress in addressing our members’ concerns, including: supporting builders and creators in our ecosystem; creating, maintaining, and communicating a clear brand strategy; direct support for DAO members; program development and exploring systems to generate value to the DAO through the community-directed creation of additional Working Groups.
The desire to further decentralize operations of the DAO was brought forward when the DAO voted against renewal and expansion for our previous Cayman Islands Administrator’s services in December of 2022. That desire spawned AIP-196: B.O.R.E.D, and upon approval by the DAO, created Working Group Zero (WG0) which successfully transitioned administrator services to new providers and assumed facilitation of the AIP process via Discourse operations. Following the transition, WG0 has allowed for the existing DAO-approved governance operations to continue virtually uninterrupted and to become improved overall. This AIP is the next phase in decentralizing the operations of the DAO into a well-researched and community-created organizational structure.


Rationale
The Working Group structure proposed within will engage a wider range of community members in the governance process, promote stability, and encourage long-term planning of DAO operations. In addition, the creation of a Governance Working group including core Initiatives: the Ape Assembly; and the DAO Secretary; will enable a governing body to facilitate Working Group operations, conduct Steward & Special Council elections, and provide increased transparency for all inter-DAO operations. Taking these actions will further enable our collective responsibility.
 Key Terms
            * Ape Assembly: A governing body of highly active governance participants within the ApeCoin Ecosystem. The Ape Assembly is an Initiative to be established within the scope of the Governance Working Group.
            * DAO Secretary: Acts as an oversight and accountability role to enhance inter-DAO communications amongst Working Groups, the Special Council, and with the DAO as a whole. The DAO Secretary role is an Initiative to be established within the scope of the Governance Working Group.
            * Funding Window: The final 15 days of February and August each calendar year in which Working Group Leads will propose Working Group Budget Proposals. Working Group budgets will be proposed twice annually for DAO-wide approval.
            * Initiative: Projects within the scope of a Working Group. This includes any individual(s) performing work for the DAO within the scope of a Working Group, using a budget ratified by that Working Group.
            * OKR (Objectives and Key Results): A means of measuring milestones or success.
            * Steward: Community members elected to serve the ApeCoin DAO within Working Groups. They have an obligation to facilitate the will of the DAO.
            * Working Group Budget Proposal: A budget proposal submitted to the DAO by the Lead of any Working Group in order to fund the execution of their charter or larger initiatives.
            * Working Group Leads: Will be selected by the Stewards of each Working Group to serve as the primary point of contact for inter-DAO operations and project management.
            * Working Groups: Community led infrastructure, allowing for the execution of specific DAO-approved mandates.
            * Working Group Charter: An AIP which outlines a Working Group’s mandate and scope, OKRs, Initiatives, Reporting Requirements, Stewards, and Budget.
            * Working Group Zero (or “WG0”): WG0 is an interim Working Group tasked with decentralizing and operationalizing the DAO. Along with the specific administrative tasks detailed in AIP-196, WG0 was tasked with proposing Official ApeCoin DAO Working Groups that will assume the responsibilities of WG0 upon the expiration of its mandate.
Specification (A detailed breakdown of the platforms and technologies that will be used.)
            * Gnosis Safe MultiSig - To be used for facilitating the use of DAO approved budgets.
            * Discourse  - The forum where our DAO facilitates DAO approved processes.
Introduction to Working Groups
Working Groups are intentional community led infrastructure, which allow for the execution of DAO-approved mandates. Working Group Charters outline a mandate for a Working Group, which must align with the vision, and values of the ApeCoin DAO.
Vision
“Culture has found new expression in web3 through art, gaming, entertainment, and events. The possibilities for blockchain’s impact on culture are so endless that they can’t possibly all be predicted yet. APE is a token made to support what’s next, controlled and built on by the community. It will serve as a decentralized protocol layer for community-led initiatives that drive culture forward into the metaverse.” - APE Foundation
“The goal of the APE Foundation is to steward the growth and development of the APE ecosystem in a fair and inclusive way.” - APE Foundation
Values
            * Boldness: We don’t shy away from the weird, the hard, or the new.
            * Equality: One APE equals one APE.
            * Transparency: Processes and decisions are shared openly with the community.
            * Collective Responsibility: We leave everything better than we found it.
            * Persistence: Success is an ouroboros, not a straight line.
Working Group Basics
            * Using these tenets as our guide, any DAO member can propose a Working Group Charter to create a new Working Group.
            * Based on Working Group Charters, any DAO member can identify improvements to current Initiatives or propose ideas on how to better meet the mandates in those charters. If approved, it would be up to the Working Group Stewards to implement these ideas.
            * If an idea is not acted on by a Working Group, any DAO member can propose that idea, with the necessary budget, as an Initiative in an AIP to be voted on by the DAO. If the DAO approves the AIP, the Working Group will be obligated to incorporate the Initiative into their operations using the budget approved by the DAO.
 Working Group Structure Inspiration
The ApeCoin DAO Working Group structure within this proposal closely resembles the ENS Working Group model combined with elements from Gnosis’ SAFE DAO.


Working Group Guidelines & Process
 1. Creation of Additional Working Groups
            * To create a new Working Group, a Process Proposal, as defined in AIP-1 Proposing the DAO (‘Process Proposal’) 1, must be approved by the DAO. This takes the form of a Working Group Charter.
            * A Process Proposal to create a new Working Group must demonstrate that the new Working Group is needed.
            * The proposal must demonstrate clearly why their mandate or scope can’t be reasonably executed inside an existing Working Group and how this new Working Group will fit into the overall structure of the DAO.
            * A Working Group Charter consists of:
            * Mandate and Scope - What does this group do?
            * OKRs, if any - How is progress measured against budget proposals?
            * Initiatives, if any - Which specific tasks or teams does this group need?
            * Reporting Requirements - How often will this group report to the DAO?
            * Stewards, if any - Who will maintain this group until the next election?
            * Budget - How much will this cost until the next Funding Window? (Can be $0)
 2. Dissolution of Working Groups
            * A Working Group can be dissolved or removed by passing a Process Proposal requesting the dissolution or removal of a Working Group.
            * Upon the dissolution of a Working Group, any and all unspent Working Group funds from that Working Group, at the time of dissolution, must be immediately returned to the DAO.
 3. Working Group Stewards
            * Each Working Group shall be managed by three Stewards, elected to serve within Working Groups for a set period of time (hereafter known as a ‘Term’ or ‘Terms’).
            * Stewards of the Governance Working Group will be elected by the DAO, following the AIP process.
            * Stewards of future Working Groups will be considered elected by the DAO if they are personally named in a proposed Working Group Charter which passes our governance process via a DAO-wide vote.
            * If no Stewards are personally named in a Working Group Charter which passes our governance process via a DAO-wide vote, the Ape Assembly will run an election to determine the Stewards of the new Working Group.
            * Stewards are responsible for supervising the operations of their Working Group.
            * Eligible members of the ApeCoin DAO may not hold either a Steward role, Special Council Role, or DAO Secretary role concurrently.
            * The responsibilities of Stewards include, but are not limited to:
            * Managing their Working Group multisig.
            * Operational tasks related to the administration and reporting requirements of their Working Group.
            * Maintaining relevant documents and their Working Group Charter.
            * Organizing and approving Initiatives within a Working Group.

            * Approving budgets for Initiatives and contributors.
            * Executing their Working Group Charters.
Steward Responsibility to the DAO
Stewards are responsible for facilitating the will of the DAO. Stewards of Working Groups can be mandated to perform tasks, set objectives and goals, sign documents and enter into agreements pending the outcome of our governance process, or an AIP. They are also responsible for their Working Group’s multi-sig wallet.
 4. Working Group Leads
            * The Stewards of each Working Group must appoint a Working Group Lead.
            * Only current elected Stewards of the Working Group are eligible to serve as a Lead within that given Working Group.
            * Leads may be appointed or removed from that role at any time by a vote among the Stewards of a Working Group, with the outcome of that vote communicated in the ApeCoin DAO governance forum.
            * In the event that a Lead steps down from the position or is removed, a new Lead must be appointed within five calendar days.
            * A Steward who is appointed to serve as a Lead of a Working Group will remain in that position from the date of appointment until the end of their term limit, or they are removed or replaced.
            * The responsibilities of Leads include, but are not limited to:
            * Acting as a project manager within the Working Group;
            * Managing meetings schedules and workshops;
            * Managing resource requests from other Working Groups, Initiatives, and contributors within a Working Group;
            * Participating in strategy calls with the Secretary and other Leads, which will be scheduled every two weeks for better alignment and broad DAO strategy.
            * Consult with DAO members on Working Group performance and milestone progress;
            * Provide reports of Working Group spending in the ApeCoin DAO governance forum; and
            * Maintain open communications with DAO participants in the ApeCoin DAO governance forum.
 5. Removal and Replacement of Working Group Stewards
            * A Steward will be removed if a Process Proposal requesting the removal of a Steward is passed, or they have reached their Term limit.
            * Stewards may step down from their position at any time by communicating their intention to step down in the ApeCoin DAO governance forum.
            * In the event that a Steward is removed, steps down, or is unable to continue as a Steward, for whatever reason, their multi-sig ownership will be revoked and the multi-sig will be operated by the two remaining Stewards along with the DAO Secretary until such a time as a new Steward is elected.
            * In the event that a Steward is removed, steps down, or is unable to continue as a Steward, for whatever reason, any temporary vacant positions will be filled by a contributor selected by the Ape Assembly, until an election to assign a new Steward to that Working Group has been completed.
 6. Working Group Budgets
            1. To request Working Group funds, Leads of each Working Group will submit Ecosystem Fund Allocation Proposals, as defined in AIP-1 Proposing the DAO (‘Ecosystem Fund Allocation Proposal’) 1 in the form of a Working Group Budget Proposal within the final 15 days (inclusive) of the months of, February and August each calendar year (each a ‘Funding Window’).
            2. In the case of an emergency, where Working Group funds are needed by a Working Group outside of a Funding Window, an Ecosystem Fund allocation proposal may be submitted at any time by the Lead of a Working Group to request funds from the DAO.
            3. Each Working Group multi-sig must have four keyholders, made up of the three current elected Stewards for that Working Group and the Secretary of the DAO.
            4. Working Group funds may be disbursed from Working Group multi-sigs with three-of-four keyholder signing.
            5. Stewards of a Working Group shall have the discretion to allocate their own Working Group funds where appropriate and where it is not illegal or in conflict with any AIPs or other rules.
            6. All requests for Steward compensation must be detailed in a Working Group Budget Proposal or Working Group Charter.
            7. Stewards may not receive compensation for their role as a Steward outside of that compensation expressly provided for in this AIP, or a Working Group Budget Proposal.
Governance Working Group Charter
*This Charter can serve as a general “template” for any DAO member to propose future Working Groups.
 1. Governance Working Group Mandate and Scope:
This group is responsible for providing neutral and objective governance oversight and support for the operations of the ApeCoin DAO. This includes, but is not limited to:
            * Providing operational support and project management support for the Foundation.
            * Coordinating the team of moderators, administrators, and lead in Discourse.
            * Assisting with transitioning of Foundation service providers.
            * Creating and maintaining policies and procedures as they relate to governance.
            * Maintaining operations and supporting governance Initiatives like the Ape Assembly and the DAO Secretary.
            * Assisting with facilitating the Special Council Election Process as outlined in AIP-137: The Special Council Nomination Process, and AIP-138: The Special Council Election Process.
 2. OKRs to complete before August 2023 Funding Window:
            * Ratify the formation of the Ape Assembly.
            * Publish and maintain a DAO handbook which explains in detail how the DAO is currently structured.
            * Assist with facilitating Cycle Two of the Special Council Election Process starting in May.
            * Assist with facilitating Cycle Two of the Governance Working Group Election Process starting in May.
 3. Governance Working Group Initiatives:
1. Discourse Administration
With Discourse being the platform in which our DAO facilitates the governance process, or AIP-1 1, the Governance Working Group would oversee the administration and project management included in facilitating Discourse operations as outlined and budgeted in the Community Discourse Facilitatorsproposal authored by @Waabam (4/5/23) and would continue to:
            * Provide operational support and project management support for the Foundation.
            * Act as the team of moderators and administrators in Discourse.
            * Act as the team of reviewers to prepare reports and any other supporting documentation necessary.
2. The Ape Assembly
The Ape Assembly is an electorate of the most highly active governance participants within the ApeCoin ecosystem. The Ape Assembly is an Initiative to be established within the scope of the Governance Working Group, which will be tasked with facilitating elections for Working Group Stewards. Voting within the Ape Assembly will be on a one vote per person basis with required proof of personhood.
The Ape Assembly can be thought of as a legislative shrewdness of ApeCoin token holders who meet regularly to discuss DAO-wide issues and collectively write AIPs to address them. This group primarily focuses on governance, coordination and transparency within the DAO.
To ensure participants in the Ape Assembly have the necessary prior experience with ApeCoin governance, we propose that members of the Ape Assembly should maintain the same DAO approved eligibility criteria in Working Group Zero from AIP-196: BORED AIP 22, including proof of personhood:
            1. $APE holders who have achieved Trust Level Status 2 (Member) or higher on the ApeCoin DAO Discourse; or
            2. $APE holders who have voted on at least 50% of the AIPs that have gone to Snapshot; or
            3. $APE holders with 50,000 APE or more in voting power and have voted on at least one AIP.
At present, this criteria represents ~500 $APE holders, or wallets. After proof of personhood criteria we expect this number to be lower.
As an Initiative within the scope of the Governance Working Group, the Ape Assembly would be compelled to request a budget and any potential for compensation from the Governance Working Group. The Ape Assembly may approve budgets for several committees, which are expected to form within the DAO.
3. The ApeCoin DAO Secretary
The ApeCoin DAO Secretary is considered an Initiative within the scope of the Governance Working Group. The Secretary acts as an oversight and accountability role to enhance inter-DAO communications amongst Working Groups, the Special Council, and with the DAO as a whole.
            * The Ape Assembly shall convene to elect an individual who will serve as the Secretary of the DAO.
            * The Secretary is subject to the same Removal and Replacement rules ratified above.
            * The Secretary would have term limits subject to the discretion of the Ape Assembly.
            * As an Initiative within the scope of the Governance Working Group, the DAO Secretary would be compelled to request a budget and compensation from the Governance Working Group.
            * Eligible members of the ApeCoin DAO may not hold either a Steward role, Special Council Role, or DAO Secretary role concurrently.
The responsibilities of the Secretary include, but are not limited to:
            1. Managing a DAO-wide calendar;
            2. Managing a DAO-wide organization chart;
            3. Publishing a monthly ApeCoin DAO Transparency Report;
            4. Publishing an annual ApeCoin DAO Progress Report;
            5. Attending Working Group meetings where possible and ensuring meeting summaries are posted in the APE governance forum;
            6. The Secretary will attend at least one meeting weekly with each Working Group where possible;
            7. Assisting Stewards with coordination challenges within Working Groups;
            8. Participating in a bi-weekly coordination call, held with the Leads from each Working Group, to align broader DAO strategy.
            9. Acting as a multi-sig signer for Working Groups.
As one of the elected Working Group Zero Stewards and a champion of this proposal, @Vulkan is proposed as the DAO Secretary subject to the term limits set by the Ape Assembly upon inception.
 4. Governance Working Group Reporting Requirements:
The Governance Working Group will publish budget and progress reports to the DAO on a quarterly basis. These reports will include Governance Initiative progress reports and budget expenditures, as well as a summary of the activities within the Governance Working Group for a given quarter.
 5. Governance Working Group Stewards & Elections:
            * This AIP will mimic the timing, election cycles, process, and eligibility criteria outlined in AIP-137: The Special Council Nomination Process, and AIP-138: The Special Council Election Process. Specifically, elections for the Governance Working Group Stewards will begin in “Cycle Two” and will take place on Discourse in the “Working Group Steward Elections” Category. These specifications are briefly outlined below:
            * Election Cycles:
            * Timing and cadence of elections: Elections shall occur every six months.
            * Nomination and election to occur over November & December; elected Steward(s) to start in January (“Cycle One”).
            * Nomination and election to occur over May & June; elected Steward(s) to start in July (“Cycle Two”).
            * The following seats will be up for election at these times:
            * Cycle One: Seat One
            * Cycle Two: Seats Two, & Three
            * Election Terms and Limits:
            * Term: Each seat is for a one-year term.
            * Term limit: An existing Governance Steward may nominate themselves for re-election and be elected to the Governance Working Group up to two terms in a row.
            * Following the term limit, the former Governance Steward must wait at least one election cycle prior to being able to nominate themselves for the Governance Working Group Steward position. In other words, if the term limit ended on Cycle One, the Steward may nominate themselves for the next Cycle Two election six months later.
As the lead author and one of the many champions of this proposal, @Amplify is a proposed Steward for this Working Group to ensure continuity. The other two Stewards will be elected by the DAO following the election cycle ratified above.
            * @Amplify will fill “Seat One” up for election in November / December 2023.
            * Seat 2, up for election in June/July 2023, will be elected by the DAO.
            * Seat 3, up for election in June/July 2023, will be elected by the DAO.
 6. Governance Working Group Budget until August 2023 Funding Window:
This AIP is requesting up to $180,000 USD in $APE using the price of APE when the grant is issued in order to fund the operations of the Governance Working Group.
            * Stewards will be compensated $9,000 USD each month in $APE using the price of APE when the grant is issued.
            * The DAO Secretary will be compensated $7,000 USD each month in $APE using the price of APE when the grant is issued.
            * The Governance Working Group will have an Operations Fund of $10,000 USD monthly.
            * The Ape Assembly will have a budget of $10,000 USD each month for community led committees.
–End of Charter–
Steps To Implement
This Ape Improvement Proposal requests the relevant parties responsible for Discourse to create a new forum category titled: “Working Group Steward Elections”.
There will be a DAO Handbook published to Discourse and housed in the Help and Resources category which will illustrate the relationships between all of the actors and groups in our DAO and how they interact and work together after the passing of this AIP, published by the Governance Working Group Steward(s).
It is expected that Working Groups will set up their own independent entities, separate from each other, and the APE Foundation.
Application, Verification, and Elections for Governance Working Group Stewards
Applicants will be invited to nominate themselves as Stewards for the Governance Working Group. In the nomination announcement within the “Working Group Steward Elections” category on Discourse, a link to a form will be provided for Applicants to submit the same information requested from applicants during the Special Council nominations and elections processes outlined in AIP-137 8.
 Timeline
Overall Cost
This AIP is requesting up to $180,000 USD in $APE using the price of APE when the grant is issued in order to fund the operations of the Governance Working Group.
The Governance Working Group will invoice the Foundation as needed against this budget until the Governance Working Group Multisig is deployed with four signers including the DAO Secretary. The Governance Working Group will then take custody of the budget.
